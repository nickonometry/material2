                <p>Dialogs inform users about a specific task and may contain critical information, require decisions, or involve
                    multiple tasks.
                </p>

                <p>Dialogs contain text and UI controls. They retain focus until dismissed or a required action has been taken.
                    Use dialogs sparingly because they are interruptive.</p>

                <p>Some dialog types include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Alerts are urgent interruptions that inform about a situation and require acknowledgement.</li>
                    <li>Simple menus display options for list items, whereas simple dialogs can provide details or actions about
                        a list item.
                    </li>
                    <li>Confirmation dialogs require users to explicitly confirm a choice.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div fxFlex="360px">
                <h4>Behavior</h4>
                <p>Dialogs should never be obscured, either by other elements or the screen edge. Dialogs always retain focus
                    until dismissed or a required action has been taken.</p>
                    <br />

                <h4>Full-screen dialogs (Mobile only)</h4>
                <p>Full-screen dialogs are best suited to complex tasks, or require an input method editor, as they group a
                    series of tasks together before they can be saved.</p>
