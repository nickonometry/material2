        <p>Clarify the connection between user input and surface reactions using radial action. Connect user input to screen
            reactions by using touch ripples to both indicate the point of touch, and to confirm that touch input was received.
            For touch or mouse, this occurs at the point of contact.</p>

        <p>Screen reactions occurring near the point of touch should occur sooner than reactions further away.</p>
